# ORBSLAM 


# Project
This project utilizes ORB-SLAMâ€™s feature-based SLAM approach with an RGB camera to extract edge lines instead of feature points and employs a ToF LiDAR sensor to build the SLAM map. 

# Goal
The goal is to integrate edge lines from the RGB camera with distance data from the ToF LiDAR sensor to create a simplified 3D SLAM solution that accurately reflects structural contours and depth information.
